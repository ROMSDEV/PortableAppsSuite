[7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org) is a file archiver with a high compression ratio for ZIP and GZIP formats, which is between 2 to 10% better than its peers, depending on the exact data tested. And 7-Zip boosts its very own [7z archive format](http://www.7-zip.org/7z.html) that also offers a significantly higher compression ratio than its peers—up to 40% higher! This is mainly because 7-Zip uses [LZMA and LZMA2 compression](http://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/discussion/45797/thread/2f6085ba), with strong compression settings and [dictionary](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Compression/Dictionary_compression) sizes, to slow but vastly improve density. If a zip tool gains its appeal from its ability to efficiently compress files, then 7-Zip proves it has a little bit o’ magic.
